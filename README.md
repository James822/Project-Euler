Solutions to Problems from the website: https://projecteuler.net/

Currently only contains a solution for problem 92.

The program was only tested on linux, but it should be possible to compile it for other platforms.
Compile the program with "g++ -std=c++14 -pedantic-errors -Wextra -Wall p92.cpp -o p92" and then "./p92" to run the program.
